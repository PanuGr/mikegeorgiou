Darkest Dungeon: The Board Game is a fully co-operative dungeon crawler game based on the hit video game. Players take on the roles of heroes who have answered the call to cleanse the ancestral estate of the horrors that lurk within. They will embark on perilous quests, battling grotesque creatures, managing stress and afflictions, and ultimately facing the terrifying bosses that reside in the deepest corners of the estate.

## Gameplay
The game unfolds over a series of campaigns, each consisting of several quests. During a quest, heroes explore locations, engage in tactical combat on a two-rank battlefield, manage their resources (including precious torches to keep the darkness at bay), and attempt to complete the quest's objective. The core mechanics revolve around action management, dice rolls, and the constant threat of stress and its debilitating effects.


## Features
- Cooperative Gameplay: Players work together to overcome challenges and achieve victory.
- Stress and Affliction System: A unique mechanic where heroes accumulate stress, potentially leading to negative afflictions that impact their performance.
- Tactical Combat: Engage in strategic combat on a two-rank battlefield, utilizing hero skills and managing positioning.
- Resource Management: Carefully manage resources like health, stress, and torchlight to survive the dungeon's perils.
- Quest-Based Campaigns: Progress through a series of interconnected quests, uncovering the mysteries of the ancestral estate.
- Boss Battles: Face off against powerful and challenging bosses at the end of each campaign.
